It uses a slightly modified docker-openvpn container from kylemanna.
It writes logs to a docker volume wich you can mount at a local dir.
So now I (and fail2ban) can easily inspect the log files.

The start_ovpn script does 2 things: Firts it adds a rule to iptables to
make sure fail2ban can intercept packets from blocked ips.
Second it starts the container with the openvpn server.
